My Name is Nelson Jarrin
I am majoting in Digital Humanites and one of my main interesting is learning new technology and improving my techinical abilities. 
This course caught my attention because it is a one credit class and it fits my hectic work life schedule. It would also be a wonderful challenge to learn a new language a in short one hour per week class.
