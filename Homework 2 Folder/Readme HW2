With homework 2, i used the draft code the professor gave us. I was able to delete the blue bar and add in a title on the bottom of the barchart. 
I created my own CSV file, using the same template of the emails.csv. instead of emails i used the header of emojis i sent out per day. 
i changed the color of the var chart to skyblue and the title to orange.
